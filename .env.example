# Environment Variables Configuration

This file contains all the Google Form configuration for the demo request form.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this file to `.env` in the project root
2. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Google Form ID
3. The entry IDs are already configured with the correct values

## Variables

- `VITE_GOOGLE_FORM_ID`: Your Google Form ID (found in the form URL)
- `VITE_ENTRY_*`: Entry IDs for each form field (already configured)

## Note

In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be exposed to the client-side code.
